## description
This was my final project for CSS143 class at UWB! <br/>
This program simulates a grocery store management system, <br/>
with the abilities to stock items in an inventory, process orders and <br/>
update the inventory to reflect all changes. You may also add items to the restock list and <br/>
display both restocking and inventory items. <br/>

all orders and starting inventory counts are stored in <br/>
the .txt files named accordingly <br/>
