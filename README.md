with the abilities to stock items in an inventory, process orders and <br/>
update the inventory to reflect all changes. You may also add items to the restock list and <br/>
display both restocking and inventory items. <br/>

all orders and starting inventory counts are stored in <br/>
the .txt files named accordingly <br/>
